Play back a rosbag recorded by rosbag_record.launch.py.

The bag stores the bandwidth-heavy sensor streams in their transport-
compressed form and they are replayed as-is; nothing is decompressed here.
Consumers subscribe through image_transport / point_cloud_transport, which
pick the transport from the topic name, so they get the raw message without
an extra republisher in between. RViz needs no help: rviz_default_plugins
depends on both libraries, and its Image and PointCloud2 displays subscribe
to .../compressed and .../zstd natively (verified against a running RViz).

Bags recorded with record_points:=false hold no D435i cloud; for those the
cloud is rebuilt here from the depth and color images. That is the one case
where something is decompressed, because depth_image_proc subscribes to the
raw images rather than through image_transport.

Do not run this against the live robot: the bag republishes /joint_states,
/tf and /robot_description, which would fight the real robot_state_publisher.

Usage:
  ros2 launch g1_bringup rosbag_play.launch.py bag:=/home/unitree/bags/pick_demo

  # Half speed, looping, starting 10 s in
  ros2 launch g1_bringup rosbag_play.launch.py bag:=./pick_demo \
      rate:=0.5 loop:=true start_offset:=10.0

  # Drive nodes off the bag clock (they need use_sim_time:=true themselves)
  ros2 launch g1_bringup rosbag_play.launch.py bag:=./pick_demo clock:=true

Playback is interactive: SPACE pauses/resumes, and Ctrl-C stops.

    color per point, whereas registering depth into the color frame drops
    everything outside the narrower color FOV -- measured 119k of 242k points
    -- and yields frame_id d435_color_optical_frame rather than
    d435_depth_optical_frame. The two frames differ by the recorded static
