# The ROS driver for Unitree Robotics G1 Humanoid

## Setup

Please install ROS 2 and some development tools like rosdep, vcs2l at first.

Then build the packages.

```shell
source /opt/ros/<ROS DISTRO>/setup.bash
mkdir -p <colcon workspace>/src
cd <colcon workspace>/src
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mqcmd196/g1_ros/refs/heads/master/jazzy.repos.yaml -O- | vcs import
sudo apt update && rosdep update && rosdep install -iqry --from-paths .
cd ..
colcon build --symlink-install --packages-up-to g1_bringup
```

## Execute

Please connect your computer to the robot following [official instruction](https://support.unitree.com/home/en/G1_developer/quick_development#heading-7). Please check the network interface name.

If the robot has Inspire RH56DFX hands and you want to move them, run the hand service:
```shell
ssh unitree@192.168.123.164  # Information required for ssh (IP address, user name, password): https://support.unitree.com/home/en/G1_developer/about_G1#heading-6
cd ~/dfx_inspire_service/build
sudo ./inspire_g1 -k -u  # This script must continue to run in the background. Required branch: https://github.com/pazeshun/dfx_inspire_service/tree/pazeshun-devel (https://github.com/unitreerobotics/dfx_inspire_service/pull/4 + https://github.com/unitreerobotics/dfx_inspire_service/pull/5
```

Then launch the nodes.

```shell
source <colcon workspace>/install/setup.bash
ros2 launch g1_bringup g1_bringup.launch.py network_interface:=<network interface name> use_d435i:=true # if you want to use d435i on the G1
```

If you want to move Inspire RH56DFX hands, run the following instead:

```shell
ros2 launch g1_bringup g1_bringup.launch.py network_interface:=<network interface name> hand_type:=inspire_dfq
```

By default, the hands close when their hardware interface is deactivated.
To disable this behavior, run the following instead:

```shell
ros2 launch g1_bringup g1_bringup.launch.py network_interface:=<network interface name> hand_type:=inspire_dfq close_hand_on_deactivate:=false
```

To activate ROS controller

```shell
ros2 control set_controller_state upper_body_controller active
```

To run hand motion demo

```shell
ros2 run g1_bringup inspire_dfx_hand_open_close_demo --ros-args -p hand:=both
```

## gear_sonic (SONIC) locomotion

`g1_hardware` provides `gear_sonic_interface`, a bridge that sends locomotion, VR 3-point upper-body and SMPL-motion commands to the [GR00T-WholeBodyControl](https://github.com/NVlabs/GR00T-WholeBodyControl) (SONIC) deploy stack over ZMQ, and `gear_sonic_controller`, a `FollowJointTrajectory` action server that lets MoveIt execute trajectories through SONIC (FK → VR 3-point targets). Enable both with `use_gear_sonic:=true` on `hardware.launch.py` or `g1_bringup.launch.py`.

`zmq_host` is the address the interface **binds** its ZMQ XPUB socket to; the deploy stack connects to it. The default `127.0.0.1` only accepts a deploy stack running on the same machine (simulation). For the real robot, set `zmq_host:=0.0.0.0`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Run **all** ROS 2 nodes and CLI commands with a non-zero `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` (e.g. `export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=1`). unitree DDS (the sim / deploy stack / g1_hardware) is fixed to domain 0 and shares the RTPS port range with ROS 2 domain 0; with MoveIt + RViz running, domain 0 runs out of participant slots and the hardware interface fails with `Failed to find a free participant index`.

### Simulation (MuJoCo)

The MuJoCo simulator of GR00T-WholeBodyControl publishes the same DDS topics as the real robot (`rt/lowstate` etc.) on the loopback interface, so the ros2_control stack (`/joint_states`, TF) works unmodified with `network_interface:=lo`.

```shell
# Terminal 1: MuJoCo simulator (in GR00T-WholeBodyControl, .venv_sim)
python gear_sonic/scripts/run_sim_loop.py
# Terminal 2: SONIC controller (in gear_sonic_deploy)
./deploy.sh --input-type zmq_manager sim
# Terminal 3: ROS driver only
ros2 launch g1_hardware hardware.launch.py network_interface:=lo use_gear_sonic:=true
# ... or the full stack with MoveIt + RViz
ros2 launch g1_bringup g1_bringup.launch.py network_interface:=lo use_gear_sonic:=true
```

### Real robot

```shell
# On this computer
ros2 launch g1_bringup g1_bringup.launch.py network_interface:=<network interface name> hand_type:=inspire_dfq use_gear_sonic:=true zmq_host:=0.0.0.0
# On the robot (in gear_sonic_deploy)
./deploy.sh --input-type zmq_manager --zmq-host <this computer's IP> real
```

### Commanding the robot

Once the deploy stack has connected (see the `gear_sonic_interface` log), enable control and send velocity commands:

```shell
ros2 service call /gear_sonic_interface/enable_control std_srvs/srv/SetBool "{data: true}"
ros2 topic pub /gear_sonic_interface/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist "{linear: {x: 0.5}}" -r 10
```

Locomotion modes (`~/mode/*` services), VR 3-point upper-body targets, base height (`~/target_height`) and full-body SMPL streaming are also available. See the header comment of `g1_hardware/include/g1_hardware/gear_sonic_interface.hpp` for the full interface. Pose targets are interpreted as URDF link poses (the `vr_3point_body_offset` keypoint offset is applied internally) and are tracked stiffly by default (`left_wrist_compliance` / `right_wrist_compliance` / `head_compliance` launch arguments, 0.0-1.0 each, 0.0 = exact tracking); targets are released when their topic stops for `pose_timeout` (0.5 s).

### MoveIt

With `use_gear_sonic:=true`, `g1_bringup.launch.py` routes MoveIt trajectory execution to `gear_sonic_controller` instead of the ros2_control `upper_body_controller`. Plan & Execute in RViz works as usual; only the wrist / torso poses are reproduced — the RL policy chooses its own whole-body joint angles.

The MoveIt model additionally gains a virtual prismatic joint `pelvis_height_joint` (world → pelvis), so IK can lower the whole body. Select the **`left_arm_with_waist`** or **`right_arm_with_waist`** planning group in RViz and drag the goal below the standing workspace: the plan uses the lift joint and, on execution, `gear_sonic_controller` converts it to the SONIC base-height command with an automatic `idle_squat`/`default` mode switch — the robot squats to reach, and stands back up when the goal returns high. Notes:

- `both_arms_with_waist` has no IK solver (two-tip group); its RViz markers fall back to the arm-only subgroups and cannot go low. Use it for joint-space goals only.
- The reachable wrist height is about 0.5 m below the standing pelvis (full lift + waist pitch limit).
- The RViz robot display keeps the legs straight while squatting (the lift joint is a planning-only dummy; the real legs are driven by the policy).

> [!WARNING]
> Do **not** activate `upper_body_controller` while SONIC is in control — its arm commands conflict with the whole-body policy. The Inspire hand controllers use separate DDS topics and can be used together with SONIC.

## Running as systemd services (on the robot)

The `systemd/` directory contains unit files to run the stack as services on the robot:

| Unit | What it runs | Autostart |
|---|---|---|
| `inspire-g1.service` | Inspire RH56DFX hand service (`inspire_g1`) | enabled (starts on boot) |
| `gear-sonic.service` | SONIC deploy stack (`gear_sonic_deploy/deploy.sh`) | manual |
| `ros2-g1-gear-sonic-bringup.service` | `g1_bringup` in the `ghcr.io/mqcmd196/g1_ros` container via `rocker` | manual |

### Install

An Ansible playbook installs the units into `/etc/systemd/system` as **symlinks** back to the files in this repository (so editing a unit here and running `systemctl daemon-reload` is enough — no copy to keep in sync) and reloads systemd.

Run on the robot itself:

```shell
ansible-playbook --ask-become-pass systemd/install.yml
```

Or from another control node (override with the repo's absolute path **on the robot**):

```shell
ansible-playbook -i <robot-host>, -u unitree --become \
    -e g1_ros_dir=/home/unitree/ros/colcon_ws/src/g1_ros \
    systemd/install.yml
```

Only `inspire-g1.service` is enabled (it has an `[Install]` section). `gear-sonic.service` and `ros2-g1-gear-sonic-bringup.service` are installed but started manually.

### Start / stop

```shell
# Start SONIC + the ROS bringup (the bringup pulls in gear-sonic via Requires=)
sudo systemctl start ros2-g1-gear-sonic-bringup
# Stop
sudo systemctl stop ros2-g1-gear-sonic-bringup gear-sonic
# Follow logs
journalctl -u ros2-g1-gear-sonic-bringup -f
journalctl -u gear-sonic -f
```

> [!NOTE]
> `ros2-g1-gear-sonic-bringup.service` runs the `ghcr.io/mqcmd196/g1_ros` container image (built from `master`), not your local workspace. Rebuild/pull the image to pick up changes that are merged to `master`.

## Contribution

### Prerequisite

```shell
sudo apt install black isort libxml2-utils pre-commit
```

### Pre-commit

Make sure `pre-commit` is run before commit.

If you want to execute `pre-commit` automatically in every `git commit` :

```shell
cd g1_ros
pre-commit install
```

If you want to execute `pre-commit` manually:

```shell
pre-commit run --all-files
```
